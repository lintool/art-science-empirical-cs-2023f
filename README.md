# The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science

‚ÅâÔ∏è This is the course website for the **Fall 2023** edition of my course.
I previously taught the course in [Fall 2022](https://github.com/lintool/art-science-empirical-cs-2022f).
I will populate this website with content throughout the semester, but if you'd like to look ahead to see what's in store, you're welcome to consult the website from last year; content will be similar, but not identical.

## Logistics

+ **Semester**: Fall 2023
+ **Instructor**: [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/)
+ **Time & Location**: Mondays 12:30pm-3:20pm, DC 2568

## Course Description

Graduate students in computer science aspire to "do computer science" (research), but what exactly does that mean?
It involves, among a multitude of activities, reading papers, learning the "state of the art", advancing knowledge, writing papers, and (hopefully) getting them published.
Graduate students learn how to do these things under tutelage of professors, but rarely is there explicit or deliberate instruction on these myriad activities.
With a focus on _empirical_ computer science, this course covers elements that comprise the research enterprise, synthesizing both "art" &mdash; personal experiences I have accumulated over the years &mdash; as well as "science" &mdash; insights derived from quantitative analyses.
The hope is that knowledge and actionable advice from this course will help graduate students better understand research, hopefully leading to more productive and fulfilling careers.

Material for this course will draw from ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barab√°si, academic papers, as well as other sources on the web.

## Scope

Context is important.
Most of the questions and issues we grapple with in this course have no simple answer.
Nearly always, it depends on context.
As such, it is important to properly scope the coverage of this course.

Wang and Barab√°si attempt to paint broad strokes with their work, encompassing all of science.
However, some of their findings and recommendations may seem at odds with realities in computer science.
Much of the "art" (e.g., advice, best practices, etc.) covered in this course is drawn from my personal experience, which will of course be colored by my own background.
I am a computer scientist (actually, also a formal linguist) by training, and I work presently at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), although over the years I have dabbled in other sub-disciplines of computer science as well.

For lack of a better term, I characterize the focus of this course as "empirical computer science", but it really is a shorthand for "stuff that I have worked on" and "stuff that I am familiar with".
NLP and IR can be characterized as "applied machine learning", so perhaps that's a more accurate scope.
The contents of this course will certainly be relevant to graduate students wishing to pursue these topics, and I suspect for related sub-disciplines in computer science such as data mining, or even perhaps computer vision (although I don't work in those fields).
However, I am quite certain that portions of this course will _not_ apply to, for example, theoretical machine learning and complexity.
All findings, advice, recommendations, etc. need to be properly contextualized.
