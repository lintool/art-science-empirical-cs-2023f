# Assignment: Paper Presentation

**The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science (Fall 2023)**

In this assignment, you will each *individually* deliver a 10-minute presentation about a paper of your choosing, related to any of the topics covered in this course.
Anything broadly in the space of ["meta-research"](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005468) is in scope.

Here are some specific examples:

+ [Reviewer bias in single- versus double-blind peer review](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1707323114)
+ [Systematic inequality and hierarchy in faculty hiring networks](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400005)
+ [Examining Citations of Natural Language Processing Literature](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.464/)
+ [Structural Scaffolds for Citation Intent Classification in Scientific Publications](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1361/)

The above list is only intended to give you a sense of the types of papers that would be interest.
I would consider these "high quality" papers that have been well vetted.
Use this list as an initial point of exploration, but you can choose one of the papers above if you wish.

Please let me know as soon as you've selected a paper, since I do not want multiple students presenting the same paper.
Paper selections are a claimed on a first-come basis once you let me know.

In your presentation, make sure you cover the following important elements of paper writing (as discussed in week 9):

+ Context
+ Gap
+ Contributions
+ Impact

And finally, address the question: "What does this mean for **me**?"
Does the paper offer any operationalizable advice for **my** career development?

I would advise talking about the above points for around 8 minutes, leaving 2 minutes for questions and a quick discussion.
Your presentation slides **must** be accessible via a URL, which I will collect prior to the class session.
I will project the slides from a single machine to minimize laptop switching time.
